# j2-language-differences Instructions

The purpose of this journal is articulate what makes one programming language different than another. This skill is very valuable in a programming career, as it will help you choose the most appropriate language for the task you are working on.

While a lot of the steps in this assignment are similar to the last journal, there are some extra steps. To complete this assignment:

1. Join the [`j2-language-differe` slack channel][2]
1. In that Slack channel, you will see a link that will take you to Github Classroom
1. Click the link and accept the `j2-language-differences` assignment and Github will create a version of the repository for you.
1. Once this step is complete, visit [the Github homepage][1] and you should now see `ITP-175-FA18/j2-language-differences` in the list on the left under Repositories.

    **Reach out to the professor if you have issues getting to this stage. Do NOT Wait!!**

1. Click the `ITP-175-FA18/j2-language-differences` repository and you will see a copy of these assignment instructions.
1. Click the `Create new file` button on this page and name it `journal.md`.
1. In `journal.md` write three things that make `command line`, `HTML`, `CSS`, or `Markdown` languages significantly different from each other.
1. For each of your three items, use the web to find a resource that helps explain or validate why that difference exists and add it do `journal.md`.

    If you're having trouble finding a resource, check out these tips on [refining web searches][3] and [filtering search results][4]

1. Scroll down and you'll see a section called `Commit new file`. In the smaller textbox type, `create journal.md` and select the Commit directly to the `master` branch option.
1. Click the green `Commit new file` button.
